Science is a systematic method of studying nature based on observation,evidence and verifications of results 

							   facts-true, data	,   reproductivity

chemistry is the study of the composition properties and transformation of matter.

matter =Anything that ocuppy spaces has mass and have volume ->solid ,liquids ,gases
mass = masure of the ammout present in an object 
weight is a force due to gravity 

composition = what is made of?

chemical compounds => Molecules ->Elements ,atoms 
properties => Description
transformations=>chemical reaction 

método científico:
	Question ,based on observation
	what is allready known
	trends and patterns 
	hypothesis->Tentative explanation 
		    Falsifible - it must be showns possibly to be false .
		    cant be unfisifable ,becausa ,an unfisifable evidence there is no technology to prove it right or errado
	experiment=>Data collection
	Draw a conclusion (Analisys of the data)

	then go back to hypotesis ,and change it or discard it 
	propose a theory 
	Theory => Scientific based explanation for something that we observe in nature at this time
	things that can prove a theory wrong or change it :
	Discovery ,better technology 

Combistion theoory called the phlogiston theory 
Phlogiston, in early chemical theory, hypothetical principle of fire, of which every combustible substance was in part composed. In this view, 
the phenomena of burning, now called oxidation, was caused by the liberation of phlogiston, with the dephlogisticated substance left as an ash 
or residue.
177y Oxygen was dicovered 
	Oxygen was discovered about 1772 by a Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who obtained it by heating potassium nitrate, mercuric oxide,
 and many other substances.

Law of nature, in the philosophy of science, a stated regularity in the relations or order of phenomena in the world that holds, under a stipulated 
set of conditions, either universally or in a stated proportion of instances.


matter cannot be created or destroyed ,In a chemical reaction mass is neither created or destroyed
Matter ->Does it have constant properties and composition  
Element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down by ordinary chemical means .(add heat or electrical current ,add chemical  if all that is made
and it doesnt change the element),it change maybe to solid,liquid etc  but not to element

A chemical compound is a pure substance that can be broken down by ordinary chemical means 
compound is a mix of 2 or more elements 
Te smallest discrete particle of an element is an atom 
the smallest discrete particle of a chemical compaund is a molecule 

A mixture is a random bleading of 2 or more pure substances that do not react ,if it reacts it is a chemical reaction 
homog e    nus            a mixture that is chemically and visually consistent 
sane kind related

heterogeneus - a mixture that is not chemically and visually the same 
different

properties of matter are physical or chemical properties 
physical are based on observation or mesurement with no change in composition of matter 

chemical properties are based on the reactivity of matter with a change in composition .
Intensive or extensive properties :
	Intensive is a property thaat does not depend on the ammount of matter present :ex melting and boiling point 
does not matter the ammout of matter ,the melting or boiling point stills the same 
	Extensive property is a property that depends of the amout of matter > Ex : mass ,volume ,energy
	chemical proooperties are always intensive properties .

mesurement is a quantitative observation that includes a number and a unit 
mesurement  	SI Base Unit	Symbol
lenght 		meter		m
mass		Kilogram	kg
temperature	kelvin		k
time 		seccond		s
amout of matter mole		mol
electric currrent ampare	A
luminous intensity candela	cd 


Volume is a derived Si base units 
	    equation that defines the parameter 
velocity wich is distance in meters/ time


Mesurement uncertanintu ,accuracy and precision 
Digital = Numbers
analog - marker that indicates the magnitude of the mesurement 

Significant figures are the digits of a number that are meaningful in terms of accuracy or precision. They include:
 Any non-zero digit. Zeros between non-zero digits as in 3003 or 45.60009. Trailing zeros only when there is a decimal point as in 6750.
 or 274.3300.
Accuracy is how close mesurement is to the true value 
Precision is how close multiple mesurementes are to each other 

Significant figures:
All digits in mesurement will count as significant 

Dimension analysis is a calculation process in wich the variables are set up so that ,the units cancel and we get the correct answer 
Density: is a physical property of matter that relates mass with volume;
d = mass/volume 
every time that you divide 2 extension properties the result is an intensive property 

Atomic Theory:
John dalton:
	1-matter is made of tiny particles called atoms 
	2-all atoms of the same elemend had the same masss and properties 
	3-atoms of different elements had a different mass and differente properties 
	4-atoms combine in small whone number ratitos form molecules 
	5-atoms are indestructible,they are not cahnged in chemical reaction 
Law of mass conservation
Laaw of definite proportions -states that elements combined in the same proportion by mass to form chemical compounds .
law of multiple proportions -whenever 2 elements form 2 or more compounds the different masses that combine with the same mass of 
a given element are always small whole number ratios.

Evolution of athomic theory :
Thomas Cathode Ray experiment ,descoberta do eletron ,porém não foi ainda nomeado eletron charge/mass ratio:1.758819x10^8c/g
Ernest Rutherford ->Most of the matal atom was empety space ,its mass was concentred in the center he called nucleus
electrons ware very far from te nucleus
Sir James Chadwick ,discovered the neutrons 
Atomic structure and symbolism 

electron outside nucleus -1.602*10^-19 (c)  unit charge 1- mass 0.00055 (amu)  0.00091*10^-24 (g)
proton  nucleus -1.602*10^-19 (c)  unit charge 1+ mass 1.00727 (amu)  6.67262*10^-24 (g)
neutron nucleus 	0 (c)	 unit charge 0 mass 1.00866(amu)	167493*10^-24 (g)

All atoms are lectrically neutral 
all atoms have ewal number of protons and eletrons 

what differentiates one element to another 
the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom ,determines the element 
the number of protons is called the atomic number Z(wich is the simble to a atomic number)
Z+ nutrons in the nucleus = A(mass number)

all atoms have some number of neutrons .number of protons + number of neutrons (nucleons)= mass number  
Atomic notation : 
	      A	
		Sy <-generic element symbol 
              Z      Mass = A ,and protons are Z 

Protium are the hydrogen-1 ,wich it have one proton and no neutrons 
também existe o tipo de hidrogenio que possui massa atomica de 2 e protons 1 ,deuterium 
também existe o que possui massa atomica 3 e protons 1 ,tritium ,unstable.

Iso  tope(isotope)
same place    :atom that have the sanme number of protons ,but differente number of neutrons 

*The mass of the atoms of all the other elements are mesured relative to the mass of  12

Average atomic weight of the element 
There are about 20 elements that have only 1 stable atom .
A stable atom has a net charge of 0. In other words, it has an equal number of protons and electrons. The positive protons cancel 
out the negative electrons. When the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons, the atom is ionized.
 (The atom is then called an ion).
For eleents with more than 1 stable atom ,we need to calculate the elements average atomic weight 
simple avarege: x1+x2+x3/3 ,or weighted avarage = multiplica a massa pela abundancia em porcentagem ,soma os elementos

A chemical formula is a representation of a pure substance that includes the symbols of the elements in the substance and subscripts to 
indicate the number of atoms of each element in the pure substance .

A atom is the smallest discrete particle of an element, a molecule is the smallest dicrete particle of a chemical compound ,a molecule 
consist of 2 or more atoms 
02	03	h20

A chemical consists of 2 or more different elements :
 h2o
There are 7 elements that exists as diatomic molecules at ordinary conditions:
	H2,n2,F2,o2,,i2,cl2,br2	    5 are gases ,1 liquid ,1 solid
						  Br2  	    I2
Hydra tes ->compaunds that have h20 aadsorbed 
water(hydrus)	


Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev was a Russian chemist and inventor. He is best remembered for formulating the Periodic Law and creating a
 farsighted version of the periodic table of elements.

column on periodic table are called groups 
row is called periods or series 
Main groups or representative elements are all in groups 1 to 2 and 13 to 18
Transition alements are in group B and main Group are in groupA

The lanthanide or lanthanoid series of chemical elements comprises the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers 57–71, 
from lanthanum through lutetium. These elements, along with the chemically similar elements scandium and yttrium, are often collectively
 known as the rare earth elements.

Actinides in the environment refer to the sources, environmental behaviour and effects of actinides in Earth's environment. Environmental
 radioactivity is not limited solely to actinides; non-actinides such as radon and radium are of note. While all actinides are radioactive, 
there are a lot of actinides or actinide-relating minerals in the Earth's crust such as uranium and thorium. These minerals are helpful in many
 ways, such as carbon-dating, most detectors, X-rays, and more.

the first column is the alcaline minerals 
Alkaline rock, any of various rocks in which the chemical content of the alkalies (potassium oxide and sodium oxide) is great enough for 
alkaline minerals to form. Such minerals may be unusually sodium rich, with a relatively high ratio of alkalies to silica (SiO2), as in the 
feldspathoids.
the seccond column alkali earth metals 
The elements in group one of the periodic table (with the exception of hydrogen - see below) are known as the alkali metals because they form 
alkaline solutions when they react with water. ... The elements in this group, which are all shiny and silvery-white in appearance, are known 
as the alkaline earth metals

column 7 halogens ,form salt
column 8 noble gases  
left of periodic table are metals ,the right from B ,si A Te Ge and Sb are meloids ,and the right are gases 

Metals -largest category of elements ,most are solids exception is Hg(mercury who is liquid)
grayish in color 
shiny 
they are good conductors of electricity 

Non0Metal ,most are gases ,1 liquid Br ,5 solids ,Brittle and poor conductor of heat and electricity 

Semi-metals -properties btween metal and nonmetal
semiconductors ,computer chips 

in molecular compouds molecules are formed by bonds btween the atoms in ionic compounds particles of opposite electrical charge are 
attracted to each other (ions)

Quando o primeiro elemento é metal ,a ligação é ionica 
ion is a atom or group of atoms with an electical charge.Small whole number .1+ to 4+ or 1- to 3-

the charge of the ion comes from the transfer of eletrons btween the neutron atoms ,they gonna gain or loose eletrons 
cations are positively charged ions 
anions are negatively charged ions 

Metals tend to form cations by loosing electrons 
metals are lectropositive ,non metals tend to form anions by gaining electrons .
polyatomic ion:
For main group metals the number of electrons given away is equal to its group number 
Ex: grupo 1A ,pode liberar um eletron ,no caso dos grupos dos não metais o numero de eletrons ganhos é igual 8- groupNumber.

caso um elemento tenho a capacidade de distribuir mais eletrons que o o outro elemento tem de receber ,o segundo por sua vez terá que ser 
repetido quantas vezes forem necessárias para haver o equilibrio ionico entre os dois elementos 
caso as bases de ionização sejam iguais (numero de envio e de recebimento),declarar apenas a nomeclatura sem a base .
Agora caso seja : k+1 + p3- aí sim declarar a necessidade de k3p (para cada p é necessário 3ks ,para equilibrio ionico)

transition metals are kind of shaddy because cant predict their charge from working from the periodic table

Nomeclature
Na+ = SodiumIon

Metal ions + post transition metal ions
name the element,use a romanian numeral to indicate the charge of the ion,then add the word ion.
fe2+ Iron(II)ion ferrausion
fe3+Iron(III)ion ferraicion

anions->monatomic anions ,polyatomic anions
Name the element changing the suffix to -ide
H hydrate hydride 
F Fluorine  -fluoride 

Polyatomic anion is either :
ate 1 more oxygen atom  ite
or ite one less than ate

exceptin:
 oh- hydroxide
 cn- cynide

The core polyatomic anions ,that end in -ate
Most polyatomic anions contain 1 or more oxygen atom
generic formula = 
  n-      n = anions , m=number of oxygen atoms in the ion	
YO

oxyanions

miscellaneous anions 
ddichromate ,means 2 chromates Cv2o1-2^

thiosol		fate
